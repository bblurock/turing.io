        %h4 Executive Director
        %p Stretching back to 2005, Jeff has more experience teaching Ruby and Rails than anyone in the world. Starting his education career with Teach for America in 2003, he’s taught middle school and high school, co-founded a middle school, and created Jumpstart Lab in 2009, Hungry Academy in 2012, and gSchool in 2013. Along the way he’s taught thousands of developers, taken nearly a hundred people from “no experience” to professional, and created over a thousand pages of instructional content.
        %p Beyond the classroom, Jeff is a prolific speaker delivering keynotes, talks, and workshops at dozens of conferences and user groups in addition to co-organizing RailsConf. He contributes regularly to open source and is among the most active Rubyists on Github. His Draper gem has been downloaded almost a million times, while the open source Curriculum repo has helped hundreds of developers raise their skills.
        %p For Turing, Jeff designs the overarching instructional program, coordinates the instructional team, connects students with the community, directs the hiring process, and teaches full-group sessions.

        %h4 Director of Growth & Operations
        %p Jorge has experience in international development and business. He spent several years building partnerships with businesses, governments and NGOs in Latin America and the Caribbean. He worked in a presidential campaign, promoted Human Rights in Cuba, launched disaster relief initiatives and raised awareness for human trafficking, among other things.
        %p Jorge worked also in technology building several products for major clients in Mexico. His products raised funds, received awards and were praised in the press. Always a student to technology, he enrolled in the first gSchool course in 2013.
        %p Since then, Jorge’s demonstrated an extreme aptitude for both programming and teaching. He started with 1-on-1 student support and quickly grew into running full group sessions, writing new curriculum, and developing software.
        %p At Turing, Jorge’s in charge of operations, coordinating software projects, and running full-group class sessions, particularly around Ruby, Ruby on Rails, and product design.

        %h4 Co-Director of Academics
        %p Rachel is a teacher first, having started in Las Vegas with Teach for America in 2007 and continuing into 2014. In 2010 she and a partner started a school within a school, the Scholars Working OverTime (SWOT) program to propel students towards college. She got her start in programming through DevBootcamp’s Chicago program in 2013. Over the 2013-2014 school year she began teaching programming to her students. Since they didn’t have computers, Rachel had them write code with paper and pencil. She acted as the computer to correct their work. Along with a friend, she launched a successful IndieGoGo campaign to build a modern computer lab for the students and accelerate their growth.
        %p At Turing, Rachel works running full-group classes, setting learning goals, preparing achievement standards, and establishing evaluation rubrics.
        %p Externally, Rachel also coordinates our community efforts, like teaching workshops and courses to high school and college students, sharing our materials with other nonprofits around the world, and figuring out how to broaden our impact beyond our walls.

        %h4 Co-Director of Academics
        %p Steve began his career as a New York City Teaching Fellow, teaching Special Education and science in high-need schools in Manhattan and Brooklyn. In 2010, he was selected to serve as one of only 250 lead teachers by New York City Department of Education. Steve is also an alumnus of the EDesign Lab, a collaboration between educators, technologists, and designers to prototype and incubate real examples of what interactive digital learning can look like to improve student engagement, motivation, and success.
        %p He developed a student information database —built in Ruby— that made data from a variety of sources easily available to teachers and administrators. Steve also started a three-week summer Code Camp in coordination with local startups to teach web development to middle and high school students.
        %p Prior to Turing, Steve was the Director of Educational Technology at the Council for Economic Education. He managed the creation and development of rich, interactive, student-driven learning experiences using the open web technologies. He has a Master's Degree in Special Education and an Advanced Diploma in Educational Technology and Leadership.

        %h4 Software Developer & Instructor
        %p Josh is Turing’s in-house philosopher whose dedication to teaching is rooted in his belief that education and empowerment are the only way to change the world. He’s a natural teacher who caught our eye with his Ruby Kickstart tutorials and the amazing Seeing is Believing Project.
        %p Josh developed his programming skills in the Air Force where he spent four years as a technical applications specialist, working with the GPS satellites used for nuclear treaty monitoring (which he claims is not as interesting as it sounds). After leaving the Air Force in 2007, Josh utilized the G.I. Bill to attend Wichita State where he earned a B.Sc in Computer Science with a minor in mathematics in 2011. Josh went on to refine his programming skills at 8th Light in Chicago.
        %p At Turing, Josh brings strong industry credentials combined with significant teaching and mentoring experience. Josh and Jeff teach the majority of full-group classes and work with the rest of the team to develop content. Josh also helps to set the standard for well-crafted code and to build a supportive community where everyone is valued and heard.

        %p Horace started his career as an architect, initially working at a small firm in Berkeley, CA. He shortly switched over to programming by attending Hungry Academy, a Turing predecessor run by LivingSocial in Washington, DC. After Hungry Academy, Horace worked on LivingSocial's consumer engineering team for 2 years, focusing especially on Service Extraction, Internal APIs, Scaling and Performance.
        %p At Turing, Horace enjoys teaching full-group sessions, working with students in small groups or 1-on-1 and writing new course materials. He runs a weekly study group on Data Structures and Algorithms and does his best to encourage development of the Turing esprit de corps.
