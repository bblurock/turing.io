    %h3 Round 1: Application
    :markdown
      The first step is to fill out [the application](http://apply.turing.io) which takes anywhere from 1-3 hours. The application asks for:

      * *Your Resume*: Help us understand your past. There are no checkbox items or exact requirements. Your resume can only help you.
      * *Writing Sample*: Can you effectively communicate and explain a complex idea?
      * *Video Response*: The video is your chance to show us your personality, spirit, and style. Make the case that you're a great fit for our community and will surpass expectations.
      * *Logic Challenge*: Writing code is about solving problems. In this series of small exercises you can demonstrate your aptitude for programming.

      After your application is submitted you'll hear back from us within **two weeks**.

    %h3 Round 2: Interview
    :markdown
      If you're selected to move forward, we'll then setup a one-hour interview either in person or over a Google Hangout to continue assessing your fit for the program. About one in four applicants makes it to this stage.

      The interview is split into two parts:

      * a conversation to gauge your passion for computer programming and culture fit for our community.
      * an aptitude exercise to gauge your likelihood of success in a highly collaborative programming environment

      Within a week of the interview you'll be notified of the final decision. Approximately one in ten students will be invited to enroll.

    %h3 Round 3: Cohort Selection
