        If you're a right fit for our software development program we'll do our best to help you afford it. Get accepted first, then we'll worry about the finances. Cost-of-living and housing are not included.
        Tuition includes a new Apple laptop, but students supplying their own "Mid 2012" or newer MacBook Air or Pro running OS X 10.9 can take a $1,200 credit from their up-front payment.

      %h3 Alternative Financing Options
      :markdown
        Interested in exploring other ways to finance your education?
        To make our program more accessible, Turing has joined forces with three great financing companies: [Earnest](https://www.meetearnest.com/turing), [Climb](https://climbcredit.co/student?schoolid=TS128551034259) and [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com).
        These partners believe so strongly in the value of a Turing School education that theyâ€™ve set up exclusive agreements with us to offer special status to Turing students.
        By working with one of these partners, you can start at Turing for as little as $1,000 up front and finance the rest at reasonable rates.

    %h3 Tuition Guarantee
    :markdown
      We guarantee that we'll help you find a job offer of at least $65,000 in the US within three months of graduation or we'll **fully refund** your tuition. To qualify you must:

      * graduate, which means passing the final assessment of the final course
      * be eligible to work in the United States
      * work with our [team](/team) to actively pursue jobs in a timely manner
      * not limit the job search to a single city or state

      Even if you **don't** meet these requirements, it's very likely we can still help you find a job. All students in our previous programs found jobs within the three month window, regardless
      of graduation.
