      %h3 Financing Options

      :markdown
        To make our program more accessible, Turing has joined forces with three great financing companies: [Earnest](https://www.meetearnest.com/turing), [Climb](https://climbcredit.co/student?schoolid=TS128551034259) and [Affirm](https://www.affirm.com).
        These partners believe so strongly in the value of a Turing School education that theyâ€™ve set up exclusive agreements with us to offer special status to Turing students.

        By working with one of these partners, you can start at Turing for as little as $1,000 up front and finance the rest at reasonable rates. You can check the financing options available below. Once you are accepted, we will send you an application link with follow up steps.

      %h3 Tuition Guarantee Notice

      :markdown
        [The Colorado Division of Private Occupational Schools (DPOS)](http://highered.colorado.gov/dpos/) informed us that it had not interpreted the law correctly and that it had made a mistake when it approved Turing's Tuition Reimbursement Guarantee. Therefore, we are no longer authorized to guarantee our students' tuition.

        This decision won't affect your outcome. We are deeply invested in your success. We are still maintaining our job search assistance program and we will continue to work with each student to develop a job search plan, get assistance in drafting resumes, prepare for technical interviews and provide professional development tools, among other things.

        **94 percent of our graduates** find employment as professional software developers within 3 months after graduation.

        If you would like more information on this change, please contact DPOS. You can find their contact information [here](http://highered.colorado.gov/DPOS/About/staff.html).
